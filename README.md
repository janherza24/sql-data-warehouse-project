## 💡 Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality isssues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Cobine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only, historization of data is no required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

---

## 💡 Business Impact

This project simulates a real-world data engineering scenario where data from multiple source systems (CRM and ERP) is integrated into a centralized data warehouse.

By implementing this solution, the following business value is enabled:

- Improved decision-making through centralized and reliable data  
- Faster analytical queries using a dimensional model (Star Schema)  
- Clear visibility into sales performance and customer behavior  
- Scalable architecture for future data growth and integration  

This approach reflects how modern data platforms support business intelligence and analytics in production environments.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a structured data platform to answer key business questions such as:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- What products generate the highest revenue?
- How do sales evolve over time?
- What are the main purchasing patterns?

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The data warehouse follows a multi-layered architecture:

- 🥉 **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingestion from source systems (CRM, ERP)  
- 🥈 **Silver Layer** → Data cleansing, standardization, and integration  
- 🥇 **Gold Layer** → Business-ready data modeled as fact and dimension tables

`Source Systems (CRM, ERP) → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Analytics`

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Diagrams
All architectural components are documented in the `/docs` folder:

- `data_architecture.png` → Overall architecture  
- `data_flow.png` → Data movement across layers  
- `data_integration.png` → Source integration logic  
- `data_model.png` → Dimensional model (Star Schema)  

---

## 🗄️ Data Modeling

The Gold layer is designed using a **Star Schema**:

### Fact Tables
- `fact_sales` → Transactional sales data

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_customers` → Customer attributes  
- `dim_products` → Product attributes  

### Design Principles
- Surrogate keys (`*_key`) for all dimensions  
- Foreign keys in fact tables referencing dimensions  
- Clear separation between facts and dimensions  
- Business-aligned naming conventions  

---

## ⚙️ ETL / ELT Process

The pipeline is implemented using SQL scripts and stored procedures:

### 1. Bronze Layer 🥉
- Raw ingestion from CSV files
- No transformations applied

### 2. Silver Layer 🥈
- Data cleansing and standardization  
- Data integration between CRM and ERP  
- Data type normalization  

### 3. Gold Layer 🥇
- Dimensional modeling  
- Fact and dimension table creation

## ✅ Data Quality

Data quality checks are implemented using SQL scripts:

- Null value validation  
- Duplicate detection  
- Referential integrity checks  
- Validation between Silver and Gold layers  

Scripts available in: `tests/`

---

## 📊 Analytics & KPIs

The Gold layer enables business-level analysis:

- Total Revenue  
- Sales by Customer  
- Product Performance  
- Sales Trends Over Time  

Example:

Cnsulta SQL

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Initialize the database:
`scripts/init_database.sql`

2. Load Bronze layer:
`scripts/bronze/proc_load_bronze.sql`

3. Load Silver layer:
`scripts/silver/proc_load_silver.sql`

4. Create Gold layer:
`scripts/gold/ddl_gold.sql`

5. Run data quality checks:
`tests/quality_checks_silver.sql`
`tests/quality_checks_gold.sql`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SQL (core transformations)
- Relational Database (Microsoft SQL Server)
- CSV files (data sources)
- Dimensional Modeling (Kimball methodology)

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Implement incremental loading strategy
- Add orchestration (Airflow)
- Automate data quality checks
- Integrate BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)

## 📈 Key Insights (Example)

Using the data warehouse, the following insights can be derived:

- Top 10 customers contribute to a significant percentage of total revenue  
- Certain product categories dominate overall sales performance  
- Sales show consistent trends based on time (seasonality potential)  

These insights demonstrate how raw data can be transformed into actionable business knowledge.
